# PackDev Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with `packdev` in 5 minutes or less.

## 💡 What is PackDev?

PackDev lets you **test your app with local package versions** before publishing them. No more `npm link` headaches or publishing beta versions for every small change!

**The Problem:**
- You're working on `my-awesome-library` 
- You want to test it in `my-app` before publishing
- Traditional solutions are messy: `npm link`, git dependencies, or constant beta publishing

**The PackDev Solution:**
```bash
cd my-app
packdev add my-awesome-library ../my-awesome-library
packdev init        # Now using local version
# Make changes to ../my-awesome-library, test immediately!
packdev finish      # Back to npm version when ready
```

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Install globally (recommended)
npm install -g packdev

# Or install locally in your project
npm install --save-dev packdev
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
packdev --version
packdev --help
```

## ⚡ 5-Minute Getting Started

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Main Project
```bash
cd my-react-app  # The app that uses packages you want to develop
```

### Step 2: Create PackDev Configuration
```bash
packdev create-config
```

### Step 3: Add Dependencies (Local or Git)
```bash
# Add local packages you want to work on
packdev add react-components ../my-react-components
packdev add utils ../my-utils-library

# Add git repositories (specific branches/tags)
packdev add ui-library https://github.com/myorg/ui-library.git#feature-branch
packdev add beta-tools github:vendor/beta-tools#v2.0-beta

# Check what you've added
packdev list
```

### 2. Start Development
```bash
packdev init  # Automatically installs dependencies
```

### 3. Finish Development
```bash
packdev finish  # Automatically restores and reinstalls dependencies
git commit -m "implement new features"
```

## 🛡️ Safety Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Prevent accidental commits with local deps
packdev setup-hooks
# Hooks are automatically installed and active in .git/hooks/
```

## 📋 Essential Commands

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `create-config` | Setup project | `packdev create-config` |
| `add <pkg> <path>` | Track package | `packdev add axios ../my-axios` |
| `add <pkg> <git-url>` | Track git repo | `packdev add ui git@github.com:org/ui.git#dev` |
| `init` | Start development (auto-installs) | `packdev init` |
| `finish` | End development (auto-installs) | `packdev finish` |
| `status` | Check current state | `packdev status` |

**Note**: `init` and `finish` automatically run `npm install` (or `yarn`/`pnpm`). Use `--no-install` flag to skip this.

## 💡 Common Scenarios

### Branch Switching Without Conflicts
```bash
# Working with local dependencies
packdev init  # Development mode active

# Need to switch branches?
packdev finish  # Clean package.json instantly

# Switch freely without conflicts
git checkout main  # ✅ No "uncommitted changes" warnings
git checkout feature/other  # ✅ Clean switching

# Resume work
git checkout your-branch
packdev init  # Back to local development
```

**Why this helps**: No package.json merge conflicts, clean git status, fast context switching between branches

### Testing Local and Git Changes
```bash
# Test local changes
packdev add @myorg/utils ../shared-utils
packdev init  # Automatically installs dependencies
# Test your changes locally

# Test git repository features
packdev add ui-components https://github.com/myorg/ui.git#experiment
packdev init  # Automatically installs with git dependency
# Test experimental branch
packdev finish  # Automatically restores and reinstalls
```

### Team Collaboration  
```bash
# Share config with team
git add .packdev.json
git commit -m "add local dev config"

# Team members use same setup
git pull
packdev init  # Automatically installs for team member
```

### Multiple Projects
```bash
# Same local package in multiple projects
cd project-a && packdev add shared ../shared && packdev init  # Auto-installs
cd project-b && packdev add shared ../shared && packdev init  # Auto-installs
# Both projects now use local ../shared
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Config not found"
```bash
# Create configuration first
packdev create-config
packdev add your-package ../path/to/package
```

### "Local path does not exist" 
```bash
# Check the path exists
ls ../path/to/package/package.json
# Fix path or create package
```

### Accidental commit blocked
```bash
# Option 1: Restore dependencies
packdev finish
git commit -m "your message"

# Option 2: Use WIP commit
git commit -m "WIP: your message"
```

### Package manager detection
```bash
# Force npm/yarn usage
npm run pack    # Uses detected package manager
yarn pack      # Forces yarn if available
```
